# [The Question]{.ul}

What is the difference in gut microbiome diversity (a count data) between Chinese w+/wo mental illness (a catagorical data) from 20-30 years old.

#### Disclaimer: 

This project analyzes simulated data. The questions and hypotheses are real, but the results and conclusions are not.

### *Sub-Field of Biology:*

Microbiology

### *Rationale and Background:*

It is surprising to know that the number of microbiomes living with a person is ten times as much as the number of human cells. The huge amount of microorganism population is therefore very important in overall physiological activities. According to Megan et al. (2017), more and more evidence has shown the bidirectional communication between nervous systems and gut microbiota, which is also called the gut-brain-axis, suggesting a growing interest in this research field. Evidence provided by Philip (2018) has shown that the gut microbiota actively interacts with the nervous system by influencing neurotransmitter production, immune responses, and inflammatory processes that are closely tied to mental health. Specifically, Microbes in the gut produce a variety of neuroactive compounds, which serve as analogue of neurotransmitter, such as serotonin, dopamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which are essential for regulating mood, cognition, and behavior. Therefore, both alterations or lack in the gut microbiome composition have been associated with an increased risk of mental health disorders, including anxiety, depression, and even neurodevelopmental disorders. In addition, in recent years, the prevalence of mental illness has witnessed a staggering rise, with factors such as life stress, academic pressure, and even cyber violence contributing to this surge. Understanding the physiological mechanisms underlying mental illness has become an urgent and critical endeavor.  Besides, there are treatment for patient suffering from mental disease by approaches such as dietary interventions, prebiotic and probiotic supplementation, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). FMT is a method that transplant the microbiota from excrement of people who is mentally healthy. This approach is based on the theory that microbiome is essential in human mental health. Therefore, having a insight into the mechanism of how microbiome influence human's mental health help us find more efficient solution to give treatment to those who suffer from mental illness.

# [Examples of relevant literature]{.ul}

### *Review article title:*

A systematic review of gut microbiota composition in observational studies of major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

#### URL:

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01456-3

#### Abstract:

The emerging understanding of gut microbiota as ‘metabolic machinery’ influencing many aspects of physiology has gained substantial attention in the field of psychiatry. This is largely due to the many overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms associated with both the potential functionality of the gut microbiota and the biological mechanisms thought to be underpinning mental disorders. In this systematic review, we synthesised the current literature investigating differences in gut microbiota composition in people with the major psychiatric disorders, major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ), compared to ‘healthy’ controls. We also explored gut microbiota composition across disorders in an attempt to elucidate potential commonalities in the microbial signatures associated with these mental disorders. Following the PRISMA guidelines, databases were searched from inception through to December 2021. We identified 44 studies (including a total of 2510 psychiatric cases and 2407 controls) that met inclusion criteria, of which 24 investigated gut microbiota composition in MDD, seven investigated gut microbiota composition in BD, and 15 investigated gut microbiota composition in SZ. Our syntheses provide no strong evidence for a difference in the number or distribution (α-diversity) of bacteria in those with a mental disorder compared to controls. However, studies were relatively consistent in reporting differences in overall community composition (β-diversity) in people with and without mental disorders. Our syntheses also identified specific bacterial taxa commonly associated with mental disorders, including lower levels of bacterial genera that produce short-chain fatty acids (e.g. butyrate), higher levels of lactic acid-producing bacteria, and higher levels of bacteria associated with glutamate and GABA metabolism. We also observed substantial heterogeneity across studies with regards to methodologies and reporting. Further prospective and experimental research using new tools and robust guidelines hold promise for improving our understanding of the role of the gut microbiota in mental and brain health and the development of interventions based on modification of gut microbiota.

#### Abstract:

A growing body of evidence point toward the bidirectional gut microbiota–brain axis playing a role in mental health. Most of this research is conducted on animals why we in this review summarize and comment upon recent studies evaluating the gut microbiome in mental health in humans. Further support for the relevance of the bidirectional gut microbiota–brain communication in mood disorders has been presented, such as the effect of probiotics on brain connectivity and mental health outcomes and pregnancy related stress on gut microbiota in the newborn child. However, the heterogeneity between studies precludes conclusions regarding differences in microbiota composition in mental disease and health and many of the studies are limited by a cross-sectional design, small sample sizes and multiple comparisons. Thus, well-designed longitudinal studies with larger sample size, accounting for confounders are needed.

# [**Hypotheses**]{.ul}

### *The Biological Hypothesis:*

Microbiome secretions, which might be neurotransmitter analogous, act on receptors on synapses cooperatively so that keep human mental state in balance.

### *The Biological Prediction:*

Individuals without mental illness have more gut microbes than that of individuals with mental illness.

### *A Statistical Alternative Hypothesis:*

There is difference in gut microbiome diversity among Chinese w+/wo mental illness from 20-30 year old.

### *A Statistical Null Hypothesis:*

There is no difference in gut microbiome diversity among Chinese w+/wo mental illness from 20-30 year old.

# [Experimental Design]{.ul}

This experiment aims to examine the level of gut microbiome diversity in those who suffeer from mental illness to find if there is a causal relationship between gut microbiome diversity and metal state. To realize the goal, we should first randomly choose those patient with mental illness from different hospital in China from 20-30 year old. The reason why my samples are not from all over the world is because there might be a relatively large difference in base value of gut microbiome diversity among different countries. Before treatment, we examine microbiome diversity in each indiudual. Then they accept cure as treatment. Several months/years later, we only examine the microbiome diversity from those individual who recover from mental illness and remove others data from the experiment. Then the microbiome diversity data is compared individually before and after treatment to see if there is a difference in mean value of two groups of data. In this experiment, the data before treatment is regarded as control group, and the data after treatment is regarded as treatment group. We may consider stratifying the data based on relevant clinical factors, such as age, gender, and diagnosis, to better understand the relationship between gut microbiome diversity and mental state so that the blocking within each layer is also realized. In this case, the control will be considered as negative. Scientists and participants should not be able to identify which group and individual is in.

### *Sampling Design:*

Probability sampling. Each member of the population has a known chance of being selected for the sample.

### *Explanatory and Response Variables:*

Explanatory Variables: mental state
Response Variables: Gut microbiome diversity (in terms of number of types of microbiome)


### *Sample size:*

1000. In the article "Gut microbiome-wide association study of depressive symptoms", there are two rounds of experiment, which have sample sizes of 1,054 and 1,539, respectively. However, the effect size in this study is small. The author tried to find a relationship between diversity of certain group of bacteria and depression. The model ended up with R^2 = 0.003, which means the change in number of that group of becteria does not result in much change in depression level.

### *Alpha:*

0.05, it is a typical cut-off value in biological field

# [Data Analysis Plan]{.ul}

Paired t-test

The research question focuses on comparing the mean value of microbiome diversity before and after treatment, rather than examining the relationship between two continuous variables. In addition, the data before and after treatment are from the same group of people, which means that the data before and after treatment is related. Therefore, the paired t test is the most appropriate method.

```

### *Interpretation of EDA:*

In the process of EDA, I first did eyeball test and ks test separately on data from individuals before treatment and after treatment. The shape of the bar plot and p-value of ks test suggest the data are not normally distributed. Then log transformation is done separately on two groups of data. Then eyeball test and ks test are done on the transformed data. The shape of bar plot and p-value of ks test suggest the transformed data are normally distributed. Then the data is tidied for paired t test. The evaluation on outliers is also done. In this case, we don't do any treatment to outliers, as the difference in mean of outliers and other data within group is much smaller than the difference in mean between groups.

# [Conclusions]{.ul}

According to the p-value of paired t test(2.2e-16), we rejected the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between mental state and microbiome diversity. According to the mean difference, the difference in mean of transformed data is -0.591022. We are very certain about the difference as the probability of having this by chance is only 2.2e-16, accoring to p-value. By combining the result from back transformation, we learn that there is on average 45.17168 more microbiome in individual who suffer from mental illness than those without mental illness, which is completely contradictory to our assumption, which is there is a significant larger amount of microbiome in individual after treatment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# [Future Directions]{.ul}

There are confounding factor, such as gender and age, which is excluded in this study and might influence the test result significantly. This study only discover the changing pattern of microbiome diversity of patient from having a mental illness to recovery. We may also study the changing pattern of that of patient through the process from mental health to a mental illness to make the result more convincing, without considering the ethical and reasonable logistic considerations.
